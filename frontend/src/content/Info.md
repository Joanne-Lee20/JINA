# What is JINA?

**JINA** is an interactive, web-based game that explores the complexities of Asian American identity through the story of its namesake main character, a Korean American girl. Created by Joanne Lee, this narrative-driven experience is designed to offer a thoughtful look at how cultural expectations, academic pressure, and personal dreams intersect and collide.

Inspired by the flash games of her childhood, Joanne began coding and creating games at a young age. **JINA** builds on that passion, weaving together programming, storytelling, and digital art to tell a deeply personal story rooted in the Asian American experience. Through simple puzzles and dialogue-based choices, players navigate Jina’s world and balance school, family, and identity.

# Purpose

More than just a game, **JINA** is a tool for reflection, designed to help young Asian Americans feel seen, understood, and empowered to think critically about their lives and futures. The game is free to play and accessible via web browser, making it easy for students and educators alike to engage with themes often missing from mainstream education and media.

**JINA** challenges the "model minority" myth by presenting a nuanced, heartfelt portrayal of what it means to grow up in the in-between—between cultures, expectations, and dreams. It is a project that blends art, code, and purpose to spark empathy, self-awareness, and conversation.
